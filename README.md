# Fix Alt Gr
A simple Minecraft mod that (mostly) fixes the [MC-127862](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-127862) bug, which sometimes makes the Alt Gr key lock your left control key in a pressed state. It prevents the bug from happening in text fields in most situations.

# Releases
You can find the releases for the mod on the [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/fix-alt-gr)
